- Provide clearer vision to pick lane during driver if the weather is bad

##  B. ABSTRACT 

Detecting lane lines while driving on the road is a task for autonomous vehicles.Despite the fact that it appears to be a simple task, it is a critical component of the project. Lane line detection is a vehicle-based system that will assist and give a self-driving car system. It will maintain the automobile on track and assist the drivers with safe driving by employing image processing to do recognition on the road lane. The developer will do the machine training by using Neural Network technique to build the line detector and then build a system that detect lane lines in real-time. The project will need computer vision to do the detection and the available computer vision at the moment is OpenCV library.
