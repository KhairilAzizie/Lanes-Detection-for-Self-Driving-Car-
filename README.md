## B .Abstract

Detecting lane lines is a task for autonomous vehicles while driving on the road. While it only seems like a simple project to do, this task is a fundamental component for the project. Lane line detection is a system that will be implemented in vehicles to aid and provide a self-driving car system. By using image processing to do recognition on the road lane, it will keep the car to stay on course and help the drivers with safe driving. The developer will do the machine training by using Neural Network technique to build the line detector and then build a system that detect lane lines in real-time. The project will need computer vision to do the detection and the available computer vision at the moment is OpenCV library.
